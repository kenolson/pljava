/**
 * Annotation on a PL/Java class to form a User Defined Type that will
 * become a new PostgreSQL <a href=
'http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/extend-type-system.html'
>base type</a>.
 *<p>
 * A class marked with this annotation must implement {@link SQLData}, and will
 * use the methods of that interface to map between its own state and an
 * internal form that PostgreSQL will store. For that to work, it must also have
 * a public, no-argument constructor.
 *<p>
 * It must also have a public, static
 * {@code parse(String value, String typeName)} method, and the ubiquitous Java
 * {@link Object#toString toString} method, which will be used to map between
 * its own state and an externally-usable, text representation. Note that, while
 * it may inherit some sort of {@code toString} method from a superclass, there
 * is a special requirement on {@code toString} for a class that will be a base
 * UDT: the method must produce exactly what the {@code parse} method can parse.
 *<p>
 * A type will be created in SQL with the {@link #name name} and, if specified,
 * {@link #schema schema} from this annotation. If not specified, the type will
 * be created with no explicit schema qualification (that is, it will go into
 * whatever schema heads the {@code search_path} at the time the commands are
 * executed), and the name will be the simple name of the annotated class.
 *<p>
 * Four functions will be declared in SQL, corresponding to the
 * {@code parse}, {@code toString}, {@link SQLData#readSQL readSQL}, and
 * {@link SQLData#writeSQL writeSQL} methods of the class. By default, the SQL
 * names given to them will use the schema, if any, given here for the class,
 * with the names based on the type name given or defaulted here, with
 * {@code _in}, {@code _out}, {@code _recv}, and {@code _send} suffixed,
 * respectively. All of those defaults (and other properties of the functions)
 * can be individually adjusted by adding {@link Function @Function} annotations
 * on a method's declaration in this class.
 *<p>
 * Other static methods in the class may be exported as SQL functions by
 * marking them with {@code @Function} in the usual way, and will not have any
 * special treatment on account of being in a UDT class. If those function
 * declarations will depend on the existence of this type, or the type must
 * refer to the functions (as it must for
 * {@link #typeModifierInput typeModifierInput} or
 * {@link #typeModifierOutput typeModifierOutput} functions, for example),
 * appropriate {@link #provides provides}/{@link #requires requires} labels must
 * be used in their {@code @Function} annotations and this annotation, to make
 * the order come out right.
